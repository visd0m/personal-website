## Professional life {#professional-life}


### the education era {#the-education-era}

Everything started with me attending a language high school in Turin, Italy.

After the high school I attended the computer science course at the University of Turin.
I got the bachelore degreee with a thesis about the experience I had as internship, 3 months of work as a android developer in the startup [Eversnap](https://www.eversnapapp.com/) in San Jose, California.


### the Satispay era {#the-satispay-era}

While I was still writing the thesis I started working at [Satispay](https://www.satispay.com/en-it/), a startup based in Milan with the mission of rewrite the history of mobile payments.
I worked in Satispay for 4 years 2015 - 2019, here I covered several roles, from mobile developer (IOS, Android) to backend developer, passing by java desktop application developer.
It has been an amazing experience for me since I has been able to develop the full stack of the application from backend apis to client UIs, with a taste of ol' good devops experience.


### the Prima era {#the-prima-era}

From 2019 I joined [Prima](https://www.prima.it/) an insurtech company where I am still working at the moment.
In Prima I worked both on the frontend and on the backend, with the great pleasure of using a really interesting stack of technologies.
Some highlights:

-   backend services in Elixir
-   backend services in Rust
-   frontend SPAs in Elm
-   GraphQL and GRPC as communication protocol betwen backend services and clients
-   CQRS + ES pattern

Always in Prima, I am starting a new adventure as engineering manager.


## Personal life {#personal-life}

I live in Lecco, Italy with my girlfriend and my dachsund ðŸŒ­ dog.

I used to like to take macro pictures, honestly I am not really active lately because I have to update my gear to keep up with the current time.
I am really into videogames since I was a child, basically I am a video game player with more than 20 years of experience.
In the last year I fell in love with emacs, I can consider myself an emacs ambassador (even now I am writing this blog post in an org file using emacs and then exporting the org to a markdown hugo compatible format).

I used to practice sports when I was younger, I practiced basketball, tennis and boxing.
At the moment I can say that time has passed and the shape of my free time changed when I started working, let's say that I decided to allocate my free time to other activities rather than sports.

AAAnd that's it, this is me, stay tuned if you are interested in software development, videogames or emacs tips and tricks.

Cheers!
