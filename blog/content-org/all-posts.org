** Professional life

*** the education era

Everything started with me attending a language high school in Turin, Italy.

After the high school I attended the computer science course at the University of Turin, where I got a bachelore degreee with a thesis about the experience I had as intern, 3 months of work as a android developer in the startup [[https://www.eversnapapp.com/][Eversnap]] in San Jose, California.

*** the Satispay era

[[https://www.satispay.com/en-it/][Satispay]] is a startup based in Milan with the mission of rewrite the history of mobile payments and I joined it in 2015 while I was still writing my bachelore degree thesis.

I worked there for 4 years, till 2019.
In those 4 years I covered several roles, from mobile developer (IOS, Android) to backend developer, passing by java desktop application developer.
Java ‚òï everywhere.

It has been an amazing experience for me since I have been able to develop the full stack of the application from backend apis to client UIs, with a taste of ol' good devops experience.

*** the Prima era

From 2019 I joined [[https://www.prima.it/][Prima]] an insurtech company where I am still working at the moment.

Here I worked both on the frontend and on the backend, with the great pleasure of using a really interesting stack of technologies.

Some highlights:
- backend services in Elixir ‚öóÔ∏è
- backend services in Rust ü¶Ä
- frontend SPAs in Elm üå≥
- GraphQL and GRPC as communication protocols üóûÔ∏è
- CQRS + ES pattern üìÉ

Always in Prima, I am starting a new adventure as engineering manager.

** Personal life

From a personal perspective I am Domenico Visconti.
I live in Lecco, Italy with my girlfriend and my dachsund üå≠ dog.

I used to like to take macro pictures, honestly I am not really active lately because I have to update my gear to keep up with the current time.

I am really into videogames since I was a child, basically I am a video game player with more than 20 years of experience.

In the last years I fell in love with emacs, I can consider myself an emacs ambassador (even now I am writing this blog post in an org file using emacs and then exporting the org to a markdown hugo compatible format).

I used to practice sports when I was younger, I practiced basketball, tennis and boxing.
At the moment I can say that time has passed and the shape of my free time changed when I started working.
Let's say that I decided to allocate my free time to other activities rather than sports.

AAAnd that's it. This is me.

Stay tuned if you are interested in software development, videogames or emacs tips and tricks.

Cheers!

** Why even do that?
If you like emacs and you are an emacs user at a certain point you will reach that moment when you try to do as much as you can directly from emacs.
No objective explanation on why this happens, but I give you my personal view on it.

I say that this what happens.
One start using a version of emacs that is far from being the perfect version of emacs for him.

Using it day by day you start customizing it and extending it making it fit your workflows and your needs.
This create a positive loop of
"I am not able to do X with emacs"
"I have fun customizing emacs in order to do X with emacs"
"I end up having a good enough workflow of doing X in emacs"
"I get used of doing X in emacs"

Replace X with blogposting and you have your answer.
