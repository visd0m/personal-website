I am a passionate software engineer.
I like coding, understanding how things work and always learning new things.
Most of my working expierence is related to the web context but I am always
open for changes.
In the web context I experienced both frontend (mobile and web) and backend
development but definetly I would define myself as backend developer.

Besides programming I really like playing video games (addicted to)
and taking pics with my reflex (especially macro photography).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Software engineer in an interesting tech stack.
A containerized microservices environment hosted on AWS, where microservices 
communicate using GraphQL and RabbitMQ, languages used are mainly Elixir, Rust 
and Elm (frontend).

Most of the microservices were using the CQRS eventsourcing paradigm.

I was part of the "Intermediari" team, working on a platform dedicatded to
insurance agents and brokers.
The platform was manly built in Elm for the frontend components, and Rust for
the backend.

Developed multiple features working mainly in the backend on Rust and Elixir
microservices.

Software engineer in different positions.

Started in the mobile team working on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.satispay.spot">Satispay Business</a> application.

Developed from scratch a Java FX Desktop client for the Satispay Bsuiness application.

Moved on the backend due to the fact that the business apps were stable enough
and, at that time, the backend team was the bottleneck for the development of
new features.
Contributed to the creation of a CI/CD pipeline for the backend development.
Contributed to the transition from a single monolithic Java application to
mutiple Java Spring microservices communicating with REST apis and events on
Amazon SNS/SQS.
Developed mutliple features.
